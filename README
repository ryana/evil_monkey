= Evil Monkey

Rails plugin to keep track of monkeypatches.  Simply wrap any monkeypatches with evil_monkey,
and evil_monkey will explode when you upgrade Rails versions.


  evil_monkey('2.3.2') do

    class << ActiveRecord::Base
      def establish_connection
        #bleh
      end
    end

  end

As soon as Rails.version does not return '2.3.2', evil_monkey will raise an exception.

This also works in tests, where I find the majority of monkeypatching happens
